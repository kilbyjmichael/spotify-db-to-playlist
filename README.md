# Spotify DB to Playlist




I requested my full listening history from Spotify this winter after seeing year after year of Spotify generated year end playlists. Regrettably, my Spotify account is only a few years old, going back to December of 2018 but I was still able to find some interesting facts out from my full listen history.

Here is DB Browser doing a query
